# Accordion

- A small React JavaScript Accordion that shows a list of sections with titles and content.
- All sections start collapsed; clicking a title toggles its own content.
- Each section is independent, so multiple sections can be open at once.
- Uses accessible markup: buttons for headers, aria-expanded/aria-controls, and hidden panels.
- Unstyled/minimally styled so it can fit any design with chevron icon rotation.
